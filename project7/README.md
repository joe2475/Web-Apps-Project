# Project 7
## Jordan Frimpter, Joseph Barsis

## To Run
```npm install --legacy-peers-dep```

```nmp run build:w```

```node webserver.js```

## Notes:

express-async-handler is added. We used this in class and professor recommended it over the async library. (it is better, I implemented both ways.) This has been added to package.json.

I didn't implement extra credit testing in the mocha api testing. I did everything else.

The photo count links to the user's photo page. This ended up being more work than it's worth but I think it's neat.
